										<h3><span>Ursula Cimone Walker</span> - Theater, Song and Dance Facilitator</h3>
										<details>
												<summary>Read more...</summary>
												<p>
												Ursula Cimone is a creative artista with a strong background in the performative arts. Her love for diversity in the arts has fueled her engagement in various expressive mediums since childhood. Though movement is one of her favorite forms, her true passion is the product of many experiences. After 5 years of dancing with Ordered Steps Productions, a unique ministry of dance based in Dallas, she realized the powerful spiritual element of dance. While studying Theatre and Dance at UT Austin, she was in a minor car accident that led to a temporary inability to dance. Recovering from this and the resulting depression, she found a passion for movement and sound as modes of healing. Her experiences with an Austin-based ensemble, the Afro Caribbean Soul Collective, inspired a profound openness of artistic flow that she wished to share with youth in the community. This past year she found herself teaching with AISD, which opened her eyes to the effect of emotional trauma in educational spaces. Further, it showed her how transformative art can be for students who suffer those traumas. These experiences have all culminated into a passion for creating safe spaces where art can be a catalyst for emotional release and spiritual wellbeing. Collaborating at Danzversity is a step towards this vision, and she is humbled and thrilled to be apart of the journey! (She also gives a shoutout to her mom for the the creative opportunities she provided our Dallas community with, and for inspiring Ursula to keep it going :)
